How to Upgrade
==============


Performance Improvements
--------------

Validation speed and network propagation performance have been greatly
improved, leading to much shorter sync and initial block download times.

- The script signature cache has been reimplemented as a "cuckoo cache",
  allowing for more signatures to be cached and faster lookups.
- Assumed-valid blocks have been introduced which allows script validation to
  be skipped for ancestors of known-good blocks, without changing the security
  model. See below for more details.
- In some cases, compact blocks are now relayed before being fully validated as
  per BIP152.
- P2P networking has been refactored with a focus on concurrency and
  throughput. Network operations are no longer bottlenecked by validation. As a
  result, block fetching is several times faster than previous releases in many
  cases.
- The UTXO cache now claims unused mempool memory. This speeds up initial block
  download as UTXO lookups are a major bottleneck there, and there is no use for
  the mempool at that stage.


Manual Pruning
--------------

DigiByte Core has supported automatically pruning the blockchain since 0.11. Pruning
the blockchain allows for significant storage space savings as the vast majority of
the downloaded data can be discarded after processing so very little of it remains
on the disk.

Manual block pruning can now be enabled by setting `-prune=1`. Once that is set,
the RPC command `pruneblockchain` can be used to prune the blockchain up to the
specified height or timestamp.

`getinfo` Deprecated
--------------------

The `getinfo` RPC command has been deprecated. Each field in the RPC call
has been moved to another command's output with that command also giving
additional information that `getinfo` did not provide. The following table
shows where each field has been moved to:

|`getinfo` field   | Moved to                                  |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------|
`"version"`	   | `getnetworkinfo()["version"]`
`"protocolversion"`| `getnetworkinfo()["protocolversion"]`
`"walletversion"`  | `getwalletinfo()["walletversion"]`
`"balance"`	   | `getwalletinfo()["balance"]`
`"blocks"`	   | `getblockchaininfo()["blocks"]`
`"timeoffset"`	   | `getnetworkinfo()["timeoffset"]`
`"connections"`	   | `getnetworkinfo()["connections"]`
`"proxy"`	   | `getnetworkinfo()["networks"][0]["proxy"]`
`"difficulty"`	   | `getblockchaininfo()["difficulty"]`
`"testnet"`	   | `getblockchaininfo()["chain"] == "test"`
`"keypoololdest"`  | `getwalletinfo()["keypoololdest"]`
`"keypoolsize"`	   | `getwalletinfo()["keypoolsize"]`
`"unlocked_until"` | `getwalletinfo()["unlocked_until"]`
`"paytxfee"`	   | `getwalletinfo()["paytxfee"]`
`"relayfee"`	   | `getnetworkinfo()["relayfee"]`
`"errors"`	   | `getnetworkinfo()["warnings"]`

ZMQ On Windows
--------------

Previously the ZeroMQ notification system was unavailable on Windows
due to various issues with ZMQ. These have been fixed upstream and
now ZMQ can be used on Windows. Please see [this document](https://github.com/digibyte/digibyte/blob/master/doc/zmq.md) for
help with using ZMQ in general.

Nested RPC Commands in Debug Console
------------------------------------

The ability to nest RPC commands has been added to the debug console. This
allows users to have the output of a command become the input to another
command without running the commands separately.

The nested RPC commands use bracket syntax (i.e. `getwalletinfo()`) and can
be nested (i.e. `getblock(getblockhash(1))`). Simple queries can be
done with square brackets where object values are accessed with either an 
array index or a non-quoted string (i.e. `listunspent()[0][txid]`). Both
commas and spaces can be used to separate parameters in both the bracket syntax
and normal RPC command syntax.

Network Activity Toggle
-----------------------

A RPC command and GUI toggle have been added to enable or disable all p2p
network activity. The network status icon in the bottom right hand corner 
is now the GUI toggle. Clicking the icon will either enable or disable all
p2p network activity. If network activity is disabled, the icon will 
be grayed out with an X on top of it.

Additionally the `setnetworkactive` RPC command has been added which does
the same thing as the GUI icon. The command takes one boolean parameter,
`true` enables networking and `false` disables it.

Out-of-sync Modal Info Layer
----------------------------

When DigiByte Core is out-of-sync on startup, a semi-transparent information
layer will be shown over top of the normal display. This layer contains
details about the current sync progress and estimates the amount of time
remaining to finish syncing. This layer can also be hidden and subsequently
unhidden by clicking on the progress bar at the bottom of the window.

Support for JSON-RPC Named Arguments
------------------------------------

Commands sent over the JSON-RPC interface and through the `digibyte-cli` binary
can now use named arguments. This follows the [JSON-RPC specification](http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification)
for passing parameters by-name with an object.

`digibyte-cli` has been updated to support this by parsing `name=value` arguments
when the `-named` option is given.

Some examples:

    src/digibyte-cli -named help command="help"
    src/digibyte-cli -named getblockhash height=0
    src/digibyte-cli -named getblock blockhash=000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f
    src/digibyte-cli -named sendtoaddress address="(snip)" amount="1.0" subtractfeefromamount=true

The order of arguments doesn't matter in this case. Named arguments are also
useful to leave out arguments that should stay at their default value. The
rarely-used arguments `comment` and `comment_to` to `sendtoaddress`, for example, can
be left out. However, this is not yet implemented for many RPC calls, this is
expected to land in a later release.

The RPC server remains fully backwards compatible with positional arguments.

Opt into RBF When Sending
-------------------------

A new startup option, `-walletrbf`, has been added to allow users to have all
transactions sent opt into RBF support. The default value for this option is
currently `false`, so transactions will not opt into RBF by default. The new
`bumpfee` RPC can be used to replace transactions that opt into RBF.

Sensitive Data Is No Longer Stored In Debug Console History
-----------------------------------------------------------

The debug console maintains a history of previously entered commands that can be
accessed by pressing the Up-arrow key so that users can easily reuse previously
entered commands. Commands which have sensitive information such as passphrases and
private keys will now have a `(...)` in place of the parameters when accessed through
the history.

Retaining the Mempool Across Restarts
-------------------------------------

The mempool will be saved to the data directory prior to shutdown
to a `mempool.dat` file. This file preserves the mempool so that when the node
restarts the mempool can be filled with transactions without waiting for new transactions
to be created. This will also preserve any changes made to a transaction through
commands such as `prioritisetransaction` so that those changes will not be lost.

Final Alert
-----------

The Alert System was [disabled and deprecated](https://digibyte.org/en/alert/2016-11-01-alert-retirement) in DigiByte Core 0.12.1 and removed in 0.13.0. 
The Alert System was retired with a maximum sequence final alert which causes any nodes
supporting the Alert System to display a static hard-coded "Alert Key Compromised" message which also
prevents any other alerts from overriding it. This final alert is hard-coded into this release
so that all old nodes receive the final alert.

GUI Changes
-----------

 - After resetting the options by clicking the `Reset Options` button 
   in the options dialog or with the `-resetguioptions` startup option, 
   the user will be prompted to choose the data directory again. This 
   is to ensure that custom data directories will be kept after the 
   option reset which clears the custom data directory set via the choose 
   datadir dialog.

 - Multiple peers can now be selected in the list of peers in the debug 
   window. This allows for users to ban or disconnect multiple peers 
   simultaneously instead of banning them one at a time.

 - An indicator has been added to the bottom right hand corner of the main
   window to indicate whether the wallet being used is a HD wallet. This
   icon will be grayed out with an X on top of it if the wallet is not a
   HD wallet.

Low-level RPC changes
----------------------

 - `importprunedfunds` only accepts two required arguments. Some versions accept
   an optional third arg, which was always ignored. Make sure to never pass more
   than two arguments.

 - The first boolean argument to `getaddednodeinfo` has been removed. This is 
   an incompatible change.

 - RPC command `getmininginfo` loses the "testnet" field in favor of the more
   generic "chain" (which has been present for years).

 - A new RPC command `preciousblock` has been added which marks a block as
   precious. A precious block will be treated as if it were received earlier
   than a competing block.

 - A new RPC command `importmulti` has been added which receives an array of 
   JSON objects representing the intention of importing a public key, a 
   private key, an address and script/p2sh

 - Use of `getrawtransaction` for retrieving confirmed transactions with unspent
   outputs has been deprecated. For now this will still work, but in the future
   it may change to only be able to retrieve information about transactions in
   the mempool or if `txindex` is enabled.

 - A new RPC command `getmemoryinfo` has been added which will return information
   about the memory usage of DigiByte Core. This was added in conjunction with
   optimizations to memory management. See [Pull #8753](https://github.com/digibyte/digibyte/pull/8753)
   for more information.

 - A new RPC command `bumpfee` has been added which allows replacing an
   unconfirmed wallet transaction that signaled RBF (see the `-walletrbf`
   startup option above) with a new transaction that pays a higher fee, and
   should be more likely to get confirmed quickly.

HTTP REST Changes
-----------------

 - UTXO set query (`GET /rest/getutxos/<checkmempool>/<txid>-<n>/<txid>-<n>
   /.../<txid>-<n>.<bin|hex|json>`) responses were changed to return status 
   code `HTTP_BAD_REQUEST` (400) instead of `HTTP_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` (500)
   when requests contain invalid parameters.

Minimum Fee Rate Policies
-------------------------

Since the changes in 0.12 to automatically limit the size of the mempool and improve the performance of block creation in mining code it has not been important for relay nodes or miners to set `-minrelaytxfee`. With this release the following concepts that were tied to this option have been separated out:
- incremental relay fee used for calculating BIP 125 replacement and mempool limiting. (1000 satoshis/kB)
- calculation of threshold for a dust output. (effectively 3 * 1000 satoshis/kB)
- minimum fee rate of a package of transactions to be included in a block created by the mining code. If miners wish to set this minimum they can use the new `-blockmintxfee` option.  (defaults to 1000 satoshis/kB)

The `-minrelaytxfee` option continues to exist but is recommended to be left unset.
=======
If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/DigiByte-Qt` (on Mac)
or `digibyted`/`digibyte-qt` (on Linux).

The first time you run version 0.15.0 or newer, your chainstate database will be converted to a
new format, which will take anywhere from a few minutes to half an hour,
depending on the speed of your machine.

Note that the block database format also changed in version 0.8.0 and there is no
automatic upgrade code from before version 0.8 to version 0.15.0 or higher. Upgrading
directly from 0.7.x and earlier without re-downloading the blockchain is not supported.
However, as usual, old wallet versions are still supported.

Downgrading warning
-------------------

Wallets created in 0.16 and later are not compatible with versions prior to 0.16
and will not work if you try to use newly created wallets in older versions. Existing
wallets that were created with older versions are not affected by this.

Compatibility
==============

<<<<<<< HEAD
DigiByte Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using
the Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista and later. Windows XP is not supported.

=======
Wallet changes
---------------

<<<<<<< HEAD
### Segwit Wallet

DigiByte Core 0.16.0 introduces full support for segwit in the wallet and user interfaces. A new `-addresstype` argument has been added, which supports `legacy`, `p2sh-segwit` (default), and `bech32` addresses. It controls what kind of addresses are produced by `getnewaddress`, `getaccountaddress`, and `createmultisigaddress`. A `-changetype` argument has also been added, with the same options, and by default equal to `-addresstype`, to control which kind of change is used.

A new `address_type` parameter has been added to the `getnewaddress` and `addmultisigaddress` RPCs to specify which type of address to generate.
A `change_type` argument has been added to the `fundrawtransaction` RPC to override the `-changetype` argument for specific transactions.

- All segwit addresses created through `getnewaddress` or `*multisig` RPCs explicitly get their redeemscripts added to the wallet file. This means that downgrading after creating a segwit address will work, as long as the wallet file is up to date.
- All segwit keys in the wallet get an implicit redeemscript added, without it being written to the file. This means recovery of an old backup will work, as long as you use new software.
- All keypool keys that are seen used in transactions explicitly get their redeemscripts added to the wallet files. This means that downgrading after recovering from a backup that includes a segwit address will work

Note that some RPCs do not yet support segwit addresses. Notably, `signmessage`/`verifymessage` doesn't support segwit addresses, nor does `importmulti` at this time. `dumpwallet`/`importwallet` work, but will (in comments) list the corresponding P2PKH addresses for all keys, even those only used in segwit addresses. Support for segwit in those RPCs will continue to be added in future versions.

P2WPKH change outputs are now used by default if any destination in the transaction is a P2WPKH or P2WSH output. This is done to ensure the change output is as indistinguishable from the other outputs as possible in either case.

### BIP173 (Bech32) Address support ("bc1..." addresses)

Full support for native segwit addresses (BIP173 / Bech32) has now been added.
This includes the ability to send to BIP173 addresses (including non-v0 ones), and generating these
addresses (including as default new addresses, see above).

A checkbox has been added to the GUI to select whether a Bech32 address or P2SH-wrapped address should be generated when using segwit addresses. When launched with `-addresstype=bech32` it is checked by default. When launched with `-addresstype=legacy` it is unchecked and disabled.

### HD-wallets by default

Due to a backward-incompatible change in the wallet database, wallets created
with version 0.16.0 will be rejected by previous versions. Also, version 0.16.0
will only create hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets.

### Replace-By-Fee by default in GUI

The send screen now uses BIP125 RBF by default, regardless of `-walletrbf`.
There is a checkbox to mark the transaction as final.

The RPC default remains unchanged: to use RBF, launch with `-walletrbf=1` or
use the `replaceable` argument for individual transactions.

### Wallets directory configuration (`-walletdir`)

DigiByte Core now has more flexibility in where the wallets directory can be
located. Previously wallet database files were stored at the top level of the
digibyte data directory. The behavior is now:

- For new installations (where the data directory doesn't already exist),
  wallets will now be stored in a new `wallets/` subdirectory inside the data
  directory by default.
- For existing nodes (where the data directory already exists), wallets will be
  stored in the data directory root by default. If a `wallets/` subdirectory
  already exists in the data directory root, then wallets will be stored in the
  `wallets/` subdirectory by default.
- The location of the wallets directory can be overridden by specifying a
  `-walletdir=<path>` option where `<path>` can be an absolute path to a
  directory or directory symlink.

Care should be taken when choosing the wallets directory location, as if it
becomes unavailable during operation, funds may be lost.

Build: Minimum GCC bumped to 4.8.x
------------------------------------
The minimum version of the GCC compiler required to compile DigiByte Core is now 4.8. No effort will be
made to support older versions of GCC. See discussion in issue #11732 for more information.
The minimum version for the Clang compiler is still 3.3. Other minimum dependency versions can be found in `doc/dependencies.md` in the repository.

Support for signalling pruned nodes (BIP159)
---------------------------------------------
Pruned nodes can now signal BIP159's NODE_NETWORK_LIMITED using service bits, in preparation for
full BIP159 support in later versions. This would allow pruned nodes to serve the most recent blocks. However, the current change does not yet include support for connecting to these pruned peers.

Performance: SHA256 assembly enabled by default
-------------------------------------------------
The SHA256 hashing optimizations for architectures supporting SSE4, which lead to ~50% speedups in SHA256 on supported hardware (~5% faster synchronization and block validation), have now been enabled by default. In previous versions they were enabled using the `--enable-experimental-asm` flag when building, but are now the default and no longer deemed experimental.

GUI changes
-----------
- Uses of "µDGB" in the GUI now also show the more colloquial term "bits", specified in BIP176.
- The option to reuse a previous address has now been removed. This was justified by the need to "resend" an invoice, but now that we have the request history, that need should be gone.
- Support for searching by TXID has been added, rather than just address and label.
- A "Use available balance" option has been added to the send coins dialog, to add the remaining available wallet balance to a transaction output.
- A toggle for unblinding the password fields on the password dialog has been added.

RPC changes
------------

### Low-level changes

- The `createrawtransaction` RPC will now accept an array or dictionary (kept for compatibility) for the `outputs` parameter. This means the order of transaction outputs can be specified by the client.
- The `fundrawtransaction` RPC will reject the previously deprecated `reserveChangeKey` option.

External wallet files
---------------------

The `-wallet=<path>` option now accepts full paths instead of requiring wallets
to be located in the -walletdir directory.

Newly created wallet format
---------------------------

If `-wallet=<path>` is specified with a path that does not exist, it will now
create a wallet directory at the specified location (containing a wallet.dat
data file, a db.log file, and database/log.?????????? files) instead of just
creating a data file at the path and storing log files in the parent
directory. This should make backing up wallets more straightforward than
before because the specified wallet path can just be directly archived without
having to look in the parent directory for transaction log files.

For backwards compatibility, wallet paths that are names of existing data files
in the `-walletdir` directory will continue to be accepted and interpreted the
same as before.

Low-level RPC changes
---------------------

- When bitcoin is not started with any `-wallet=<path>` options, the name of
  the default wallet returned by `getwalletinfo` and `listwallets` RPCs is
  now the empty string `""` instead of `"wallet.dat"`. If bitcoin is started
  with any `-wallet=<path>` options, there is no change in behavior, and the
  name of any wallet is just its `<path>` string.

### Logging

- The log timestamp format is now ISO 8601 (e.g. "2018-02-28T12:34:56Z").
